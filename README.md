# Simple and Effective E2E Test Architecture with Playwright and TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a simple yet effective structure for E2E testing using Playwright and TypeScript.

## Introduction

This project showcases the architecture described in the article "Simple and Effective E2E Test Architecture with Playwright and TypeScript". The architecture aims to:
- Facilitate faster setup and maintenance of tests by clear separation of components.
- Improve code readability and scalability through the use of the Page Object Model (POM).
- Reduce risks and increase test reliability by utilizing the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and efficient locator selection.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Object**: Each Feature Object corresponds to a specific feature, simplifying the understanding of what each file is responsible for and reducing the risk of accidental changes.
- **Separation of API and UI**: Storing API and UI methods separately to clearly demarcate responsibilities and reduce dependencies.
- **Fixtures**: Easy integration of API and UI methods in tests, simplifying context switching.



This repository is a practical implementation of the architecture described in the article. I hope it helps you in setting up and maintaining your E2E tests more efficiently.
